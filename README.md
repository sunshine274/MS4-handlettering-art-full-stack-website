<h1 align="center">MS4-Lettering Graphic Design E-shop</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://ms4-lettering-design-e-shop.herokuapp.com)

This is my full-stack e-commerce website built while studying Django under extremely tight deadline and I will keep on working on it after the submission deadline.

This website aims to sell handlettering design services to cutstomers, therefore it should be able to:
1. add/delete/modify/display products
2. allow new customers to register
3. allow old customers to login and track former order information
4. allow customers to customise their own preferred handlettering designs
5. allow customers to securely checkout and make card payment

## Design Choices

Since I really appreciate the classic design of Boutique Ado from CI course, the main design is inspired from it, but I have modified the main fonts to Montserrat to deliver a more elegant visual effect.

### Colours

I used this greyish green as the theme color, to deliver a modern and clean impression, although black and white are still the main colors because the product page will be filled with colorful images.

## Wireframes

The wireframes were created using app downloaded from [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

## **Deployment**

### **Local**

* This project is deployed live on [**Heroku**](https://pq-the-philanthropist.herokuapp.com/).

* You can run the code in your chosen local **Integrated Development Environment** (**IDE**, e.g. [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com), [**AWS CLoud9**](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9)).
    1. Open the **Project Repository** in [**Github**](https://github.com/an-slua-sidhe/milestone-3).
    2. Look for the green *Coded* button at the top right of the repository.
    3. If using [**Github Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com), chose to *Open in Desktop*.
    4. If you want to **Clone** the files into a **Git** repository, chose to copy the URL from the same menu (# 2.). Open your chosen **Command Line Interface** (**CLI**, e.g. [**Gitbash**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)) and use the following command:


        ``` bash
        git clone https://github.com/an-slua-sidhe/milestone-3.git
        ```

    5. To set up the files manually in a local repository, chose to **Download ZIP** and remove the files from the ZIP folder. Place them into the chosen location. If desired, set up a **Git** repository in this folder in your **CLI** with the following command:

        

        ``` bash
        git init
        ```

    6. You can check the state of your repository after initialising it by using this command:

        

        ``` bash
        git status
        ```

### **Remote**

* To push the code to a remote repository, follow the steps below (I use **Github** as an example).

    1. After using the command 'git status' (see step 6 above) in the command line, check that the console reads:


        ``` bash
        Nothing to commit
        working tree clean
        ```

    2. Next, link your remote repository. For **Github**, open your Github account and select *Repositories*. At the top right of the screen select *New*.

    3. Give your repository a name. Keep it short and avoid underscores.

    4. You can now choose a few different ways to link the local and remote repositories. The one we want here is "â€¦*or push an existing repository from the command line*". Copy the code this option gives you and paste it into your command line. It should look something like this:

        ``` bash
        git remote add origin https://github.com/an-slua-sidhe/milestone-2
        git push -u origin master
        ```

    5. Now you can push any changes from the command line with:

        ``` bash
        git push
        ```

    6. If you check the status of of your local repository now (using 'git status') it should give you something like this:

        ``` bash
        On branch master
        Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
        nothing to commit, working tree clean
        ```

    7. Finally, to deploy the code live with **Github Pages**, open the repository in your **Github** account and select '*Settings*' at the top right of the page. Scroll down to the *Github Pages* section. Click on the '*None*' button. Select the correct branch from the menu. Now click on the URL link to visit the deployed site.

### **Heroku**

* To push the code to a Heroku and deploy it dynamically, follow the steps below.

    1. Following on from **Local** deployment step 6 above, type the command 'git status' in the command line and check that the console reads:

        ``` bash
        Nothing to commit
        working tree clean
        ```

    2. Next, create an App on Heroku. Log in to your previous Heroku account or set up a new one, select the *New* button on the top right of the screen, then select *Create New App*.

    3. Name your app (usinb only lowercase characters and dashes) and choose the regional server that best suits your location.

    4. Next, login to your Heroku account from your CLI using:

        ``` bash
        heroku login
        ```

        A browser window should open up where you can click to login to your account through your local IDE. If this does not open, select the link on the CLI with *ctrl + c* and open it manually.

    5. Link your existing Git repository to Heroku by adding Heroku as a remote repository:


        ``` bash
        heroku git:remote -a <project-name>
        ```

    6. From now on you can push your code from the CLI with:

        ``` bash
        git push heroku master
        ```

    7. Set the necessary *Environment Variables*. Select the *Settings* tab, and then select the *Config Vars* button. Enter the KEY - VALUE pairs for your config variables here (e.g. SECRET_KEY, IP, PORT etc.)

    8. Finally, select the *Open App* button the top right of the screen to see your deployed application.
